## Online Audio Recorder for Hipcam

A simple page with form, where a user (worker) can upload audio files to [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com) (AMT). 
The user can upload a Wake word (e.g. “Ok, Google”, “Hey, Siri”). 

Amazon MTurk is a service, where requesters create HITs (submissions) to collect data and workers complete the task and receive a monetary reward.

The form contains fields for user's age, gender and a tool for creation audio records, and uploads audio to our personal file server.

Serverside part - inside server/ folder - simple file uploading form.
